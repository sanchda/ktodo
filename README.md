# ktodo
A personal todo list written in K3

I wrote this after seeing on article on HackerNews about a minimalistic, CLI-driven todo-list manager.  It called down multiple rather heavy dependencies and weighed in at several hundred lines of code, so I thought I'd see how much effort it took in K without any real dependencies (aside from a VT-100 compatible terminal).
